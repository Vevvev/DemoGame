# DemoGame
A repository that holds a 3D Java game in JMonkey Engine. It is mostly a demo for me to learn and understand the engine, as well as how to make a fun experience in a virtual world.

The game is currently a side scrolling game where you play as a "snowman" that jumps over obstacles that are coming for it. As the game goes on the obstacles get faster and eventually gain the ability to fly adding to the challenge!
